## How to Use These Tickets

Each ticket contains:
- **Description** - A brief overview of the ticket's purpose
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific requirements that must be met
- **Technical Notes** - Implementation guidance and considerations
- **Priority** - High/Medium/Low importance
- **Estimated Effort** - Rough time estimate for completion

When implementing, it's recommended to:
1. Work through phases sequentially
2. Within phases, focus on high priority tickets first
3. Use the technical notes as guidance, not strict requirements
4. Update tickets as implementation progresses

## Best Practices for Implementation

- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Create a branch for each ticket or related group of tickets
- Write tests when implementing critical functionality
- Document any significant deviations from the original plan
- Consider UX throughout implementation, not just in the UI polish phase

To begin implementation:
1. Review Phase 1 tickets in detail
2. Set up development environment as described in the main README
3. Create initial project structure
