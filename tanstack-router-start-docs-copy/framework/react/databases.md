Databases are at the core of any dynamic application, providing the necessary infrastructure to store, retrieve, and manage data. TanStack Start makes it easy to integrate with a variety of databases, offering a flexible approach to managing your application's data layer.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any database provider**, so if you already have a preferred database system, you can integrate it with TanStack Start using the provided full-stack APIs. Whether you're working with SQL, NoSQL, or other types of databases, TanStack Start can handle your needs.

That said, the choice of a database is critical to your application's performance, scalability, and reliability, which is we highly recommend using [Convex](https://convex.dev?utm_source=tanstack) for the best possible database experience.
